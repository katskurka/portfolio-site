# portfolio-site
1.	Identify the component of this assignment that you did the
best on, and why. 
a.	I was happy when I successfully built the navbar and managed to get things positioned where I wanted them. Iâ€™m still working on understanding how the positioning works.
2.	Describe in plain English what problem this assignment was
posing, and what your solution was to it.
a.	I started building the portfolio site without a clear idea of what exactly I wanted it to look like, which caused my first couple of starts to be a little chaotic. I solved this by taking a step back, planning out the layout I intended along with any pictures/colors I wanted to use and beginning again in a step-by-step manner. 
3.	What was your approach or process? 
a.	My approach was to first build out a rough sketch/idea of how I wanted the site to look, gather all source materials I needed (pictures, color hex codes, fonts, etc). I then wrote the html structure with placeholder text to have a basic text layout of the site. Then I began adding in CSS to each html section until I had the exact look I wanted for the site. I broke each individual layer of the site down into pieces (navbar, header, etc) and played around with the style until I had it looking how I envisioned.
4.	What were your challenges? 
a.	It was challenging to dissect the CSS I would need and learn about all the different CSS properties and how each affected the page and interacted with other included properties
5.	What resources did you use?   
a.	Resources I used were W3schools, Youtube, a CSS book I am reading (CSS: the definitive guide) and javascript.info.
